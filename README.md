# Face_Emotion_Detection_System
Face Emotion Detection System is a Python-based computer vision and deep learning project that detects human emotions from facial expressions in real time or from images/videos. The system uses OpenCV for face detection and a trained deep learning model to classify emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Neutral, Fear, and Disgust.

🎯 Objectives
- Detect human faces accurately from images or video streams
- Analyze facial expressions
- Classify emotions such as:
  - Happy 😊
  - Sad 😢
  - Angry 😠
  - Surprise 😲
  - Fear 😨
  - Disgust 🤢
  - Neutral 😐
- Display emotion results in real-time

🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – for face detection and image processing
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – for building and loading deep learning models
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – for visualization (optional)
- **Haar Cascade / CNN** – for face detection
- **Deep Learning (CNN)** – for emotion classification
